# Egier Production Trend Analysis

## Overview
This mini project analyzes **mock monthly bag production data** from EGIER, an outdoor equipment manufacturer in Bandung.  
The data is **not real** and is used only to demonstrate numerical analysis techniques.

The purpose of this project is to **showcase my understanding of numerical methods** and how they can be **implemented in Python** for trend analysis and prediction.

## Objectives
- Model production trends using **polynomial regression**
- Predict when **warehouse capacity** will be exceeded
- Analyze **production rate** and **total output** numerically

## Methods & Tools
- Polynomial regression  
- Numerical differentiation & integration  
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)

## Notes
- All data is **mockup**
- Focus is on **numerical methods**, not business accuracy
- Built as a **portfolio mini project**
